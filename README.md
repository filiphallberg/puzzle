# Run locally

Use whatever package manager you like and install packages, then run the `start` script. I use yarn out of habit:
`yarn install` -> `yarn start`

# Puzzle functionality

The puzzle can in theory take any amout of rows/columns - but I've narrowed it down to a maximum of 15 for each. Pick and choose your own configuration in the select inputs. You can solve or shuffle the puzzle with the respective buttons.

# Notes

Took ~3hrs to put together. Animations and timings can be improved to enhance UX.
